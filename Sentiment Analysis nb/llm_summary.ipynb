      "I'd had a USB mic that this replaced; the old one worked fine but had a USB-B socket on it and the slightest bump might disconnect the USB and cause problems with the app I was using. I got this one just to get USB-C, and it's working great! It doesn't have any extra bells or whistles - no gain control, no noise reduction, etc - just a single pushbutton for mute. But that's all I need. Threaded onto my existing boom and replaced the USB-B cord with a USB-C cord, and I'm back in business.It comes with a weighted base and a USB cord, both of which are now cluttering my junk drawer. Personally I'd prefer to buy a mic as a \"Component\" and not as a system, but I understand not everyone would want that. Nothing deducted from the score on that count, but it WOULD be less wasteful.\n",
